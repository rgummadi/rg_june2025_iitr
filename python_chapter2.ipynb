    "\n",
    "#In machine learning and statistics, **Huber distance** is a special way of measuring the error between two values — typically the *actual* and the *predicted*. It’s designed to be *less sensitive to outliers* than the usual squared error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the difference between the actual and predicted value is **small**, we treat the error like **squared error**.\n",
    "* If the difference is **large**, we treat it more like **absolute error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point where we switch between these two behaviors is decided by a value called **delta**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute the Huber distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, find the **error** by subtracting the predicted value from the actual value.\n",
    "2. If the absolute value of the error is **less than or equal to delta**, use the squared error formula.\n",
    "3. Otherwise, use a modified absolute error formula that uses delta.\n",

    "### **Topic:** *Are Rectangles Intersecting?*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A **rectangle** on a 2D plane can be defined by its two opposite corners — the bottom-left and the top-right. For example, suppose a rectangle has its bottom-left corner at (1, 2) and top-right corner at (4, 5). This rectangle stretches from x = 1 to x = 4 and from y = 2 to y = 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two rectangles are said to **intersect** if they share **any area** — even a single point on their boundary counts. If one is completely to the left, right, above, or below the other, then they **do not intersect**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Exercise:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function `are_rectangles_intersecting(rect1, rect2)` that takes two rectangles and returns `True` if they intersect, otherwise returns `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each rectangle is represented as a tuple of two points:\n",
    "`((x1, y1), (x2, y2))`, where\n",
    "\n",
    "* `(x1, y1)` is the **bottom-left corner**\n",
    "* `(x2, y2)` is the **top-right corner**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Function Signature:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def are_rectangles_intersecting(rect1: tuple, rect2: tuple) -> bool:\n",
